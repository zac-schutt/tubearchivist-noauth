# tubearchivist-noauth

This docker image just takes bbilly1/tubearchivist and removes the authentication. Fixes casting to other devices at the expense of privacy of the media.

WARNING: **ONLY USE THIS WHEN PROTECTED BY OTHER MEANS SUCH AS FIREWALL OR REVERSE PROXY. DO NOT EXPOSE THIS VERISON OF TUBEARCHIVIST TO THE PUBLIC INTERNET**

Full project readme available at [tubearchivist github](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist).
